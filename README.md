The safety of women is a concern of increasing urgency in India and other countries. The primary issue in the handling of these cases by the police lies in constraints preventing them from responding quickly to calls of distress.

❖ These constraints include not knowing the location of the crime, and not knowing the crime is occurring at all: at the victim’send, reaching the police assuredly and discreetly is a challenge. 
❖ To aid in the removal of these constraints, we introduces a mobile application called Women Shield (Women's Safety App) that provides women with a reliable way to place an emergency SMS to the police.
❖ The user can easily and discreetly trigger the SMS function by the shaking her phone, or by explicitly interacting with the user interface of application via a simple press of a START button on the screen.
❑ A message containing the accurate geographical location of the user, as well as contact details is immediately sent to the police without any delay.

The user can easily and discreetly trigger the SMS function by the shaking her phone automatically detection of danger situations, or by explicitly interacting with the user interface of application via a simple press of a
START button on the screen.
